My Flask Server Setup:
1. SSH into a remote instance of an ubuntu:xenial web server using a priavet key
2. The web server is going to be used as a enviorement for testing our code so we have to configure it
3. to do this we are going to set up docker on it and pull our image to use it to generate a container on our server
