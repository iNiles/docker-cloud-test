## Agenda

### Git

* Merge conflicts

### Where are we now?

* Bash
* Git
* Github
* Docker
* Docker Cloud
* Python Unit Testing

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Born out of the "Extreme Programming" agile development method.

The basic idea:

1) Determine what you want your code to do.

2) Write a new test that checks for the desired functionality.

3) Run tests.  (Should fail the first time.)

4) Edit/write the code for your new feature.

5) Re-run tests.  If failures still exist, back to 4.

(We did this with the bash koans.)

### TDD with docker-cloud-test

Our next step is to start building a running flask server
in our Docker container.  We'll do this using a test-driven
development approach.

**Prep your local repository**

1) Make sure it is up to date with any merged pull requests on github.

```bash
git checkout master
git pull origin master
```

2) Cut a new branch off of master for your TDD flask work.

```bash
git checkout -b [branch name]
```

**Create the Test**

1) Alter your `run_test.sh` file to look like the following:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Running Flask Unit Tests"
python3 unh698_test.py
```

2) Create an empty `unh698.py` file.

3) Create a `unh698_test.py` file with these contents:

```python
import unittest

import unh698


class FlaskrTestCase(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        self.app = unh698.app.test_client()

    def tearDown(self):
        pass

    def test_home_page(self):
        # Render the / path of the website
        rv = self.app.get('/')
        # Chech that the page contians the desired phrase
        assert b'UNH698 Website' in rv.data


if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

**Ensure the test runs, but fails**

1) Commit the changes to `run_test.sh`, `unh698.py`, and `unh698_test.py` to your branch.

2) Push your branch to your github, and start a pull request.

3) Add a comment on your pull request with the contents @MathYourLife
so I can see how you're doing.  Feel free to @mention other students
in class to get their help as well.  You can find the list here https://github.com/orgs/unh-comp-698-systems-software/people .

4) Verify that the build in docker cloud attempts to run the python unit tests but fails.  You should see an error like 

	python3: command not found

**Make the test pass**

1) Make changes to either `Dockerfile` and/or `unh698.py` to attempt to make the test pass.

Hints:

* The Dockerfile controls what in installed on the server.
* The app.py controls how the Flask website will run.
* Start with changing just the Dockerfile until you can get the python
test to actually run.
* Then move on to setting up the unh698.py file correctly.

References:

* Search "how to build flask application in docker"
* Flask 0.12 documentation http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/

2) Commit and push changes to the github branch.  If the test passes,
merge and submit a link to your pull request.  If the test fails, 
return to step 4.
