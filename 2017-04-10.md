## Agenda

Today we'll be focussing on automating the configuration 
management of a server.  Last week, you were given access
to a personal server and then tasked with setting it up
to run your Docker-based Flask website.

## Documentation

Documention has been stressed as important for our work
this semester, and in the last week started to get a
feel for how important it is to reliable and 
efficiently reproduce a series of tasks.


### Read/Review/Discuss these posts on CI/CD

**Discussion questions**

* What were some items that you were most surprised by?
* What similarities to you see between the different 
companies/groups?
* What is something that one company/group does that
seems like it would be really helpful?
* Which post was the easiest to understand?
	* What made it that way?
	* Were there things that other posts should have added?
* Discuss how these methodoliges compare with what you have
in place for your Flask website.
	* Are there parallels?
	* What could be added?


**Document Your Release Process**

Now that you've read and discussed different approaches
to developing/integrating/testing/deploying code, 
take some time to create a first draft of the process
you use for you Flask website.

* Create a new markdown file in your docker-cloud-test 
repository named deployment.md and create a link to it
in your main README.md file.
* Commit and push your draft to your docker-cloud-test
repository on github, and create a pull request.
* Share your pull request with your group.
* Review and provide feedback on the draft.
* Review the feedback on your own document.
* Update your documentation based on suggestions.
* Merge your pull request when you are satisfied with the
first draft of your document.


## Ansible

What we'll cover today.

* What is ansible?  http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/
* How does it work? (demo to follow)
* What can I configure with it? http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/list_of_all_modules.html


**Installing Ansible on your laptop**

Install ansible on your laptop using pip.

```bash
pip install ansible
```

**Demo**

Ansible basics

**Create the start of your ansible playbooks**

In another new branch on your docker-cloud-test repository:

* create an ansible folder
* convert the steps to your Flask website deployment into an ansible playbook.

Note: Make sure not to change anything on your server until
after your Flask website assignment has been graded.  You
can use the "dry-run" setting to test without making changes.

HW:

* Finish the deployment of your Flask website (due Tuesday 4/11)
* Convert your notes on setting up your Docker-based 
Flask website into an ansible-playbook
