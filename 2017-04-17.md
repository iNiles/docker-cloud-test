## Agenda

* state of the world
* git tags
* connecting git tags to docker images via docker cloud builds
* release a new website
* ansible configuration script

## Git Tags

As you may remeber from the git tutorial work, a git tag is a reference to a specific
commit hash.  Tags are unique and can only point to a single snapshot of your code.
Here, we're going to use git tags to version the docker images built by docker cloud
and then use those versioned images to later control what version of the application 
is running in production.

Hint: When adding tags, make sure your local repository matches with the remote/github
version of the repository.

```bash
git checkout master
git pull origin master
```

Our docker cloud configuration has been setup to build an imaged tagged as "latest" 
based on the most recent commit in the master branch in github.

For my repository, https://github.com/MathYourLife/docker-cloud-test, the docker image that 
built is `mathyourlife/docker-cloud-test` and using the "lastest" tagged image would
look like:

```bash
# If no version is specified, "latest" is assumed
docker pull mathyourlife/docker-cloud-test

# Specifying a version of the image is done by appending it to the image with a semicolon.
docker pull mathyourlife/docker-cloud-test:latest
```

Set your most recent commit to your docker-cloud-test's master branch to 0.0.1.

```bash
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git tag 0.0.1
```

Push your tags to github and verify through the UI that they exist.

```bash
git push --tags origin master
```

## Docker Cloud Build Versioned Images

Next, we need to update our docker cloud build configuration to build both a "latest" image
and one specific to any tags that are added to our github repository.

Steps:

* Go to your docker cloud account https://cloud.docker.com/
* Select "Repostories" -> your docker-cloud-test repository -> Builds -> Configure Automated Builds
* Add a new build rule (plus sign next to the Build Rules section)
	* Source Type: Tag
	* Source: /^[0-9.]+$/
	* Docker Tag: release-{sourceref}
	* Dockerfile location: Dockerfile
* Save and Build
* Verify that your "Recent Builds" section builds both a master and 0.0.1 image.

View all your available image versions.

* Go to https://hub.docker.com/
* Select your docker-cloud-test repository -> Tags

## Release your 0.0.1 website

On your aws server, replace the currently running container with one pinned at the 0.0.1 release.

In your `docker run` command append the tag version to the image.  Mine would include a
`mathyourlife/docker-cloud-test:release-0.0.1`.  Verify that your site is still accessible from the world.

## Release a New Website

Your `unh698.py` script should currently contain logic for a home page with the text `UNH698 Website` in it.
Pick a topic that inspires you.  You will be adding a page to your server expounding on your chosen topic.

**Adding a Test**

Before adding any code to the webserver, we want to add a test that will initially fail, but then pass
as we add the functionality.  Add a method to the `FlaskrTestCase` that will test for some text
that will exist on your future page.

```python
    def test_link_to_my_page(self):
        rv = self.app.get('/')  
        # Search the page contents for the link to your topic page 
        # Replace xxxxxxxxxxxx with text you'd expect to see on your main page that links to your subpage
        assert b'xxxxxxxxxxxx' in rv.data 

    def test_my_topic(self):
        # Replace '/' with the page path you want to make
        rv = self.app.get('/')  
        # Replace UNH698 Website with the text you expect to see on you topic page
        assert b'UNH698 Website' in rv.data 
```

Cut a new branch off of master, commit your changes to `unh698_test.py`, and push to github.

Verify that the docker build fails since your topic page does not exist yet.

**Create your new page**

Modify your `unh698.py` file to include your topic page and a hyper link on your home page to your topic page.
Start with just the minimal text required to make your test pass.  Commit the new text to your page and push 
to your github branch.

After your tests pass, it's time to add the flair.  Style points awarded if you can add use a framework like bootstrap
or use the jinja2 templating.

**Publish your new page in a new docker image**

Once you are satisfied with your new page (and it still passes the docker build test)

* merge your github PR
* pull your newest master changes back to your local repo
	```bash
	git checkout master
	git pull
	```
* add your next git tag of 0.0.2
	```bash
	git tag 0.0.2
	```
* push your tags to github
	```bash
	git push --tags origin master
	```

## Ansible deployment

Next we'll be using an ansible playbook to run two versions of your website on a clean server (yes, your servers 
are being deleted again).  A production version based on the 0.0.1
version of your code, and a staging version based on the 0.0.2 version of your code.

I'll add a folder to the notes project https://github.com/unh-comp-698-systems-software/notes called `ansible`
which will contain the general structure of the playbook required to setup docker and further instructions.
